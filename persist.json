Intercontinental prediction of soybean phenology via hybrid\nensemble of knowledge-based and data-driven models. In Silico Plants 2021: diab004; doi: 10.1093/insilicoplants/diab004\nABSTRACT\nThe timing of crop development has significant impacts on management decisions and subsequent yield formation.\nA large intercontinental dataset recording the timing of soybean developmental stages was used to establish ensembling\napproaches that leverage both knowledge-based, human-defined models of soybean phenology and data-driven, machine-\nlearned models to achieve accurate and interpretable predictions. We demonstrate that the knowledge-based models can\nimprove machine learning by generating expert-engineered features. The collection of knowledge-based and data-driven\nmodels was combined via super learning to both improve prediction and identify the most performant models. Stacking\nthe predictions of the component models resulted in a mean absolute error of 4.41 and 5.27 days to flowering (R1) and\nphysiological maturity (R7), providing an improvement relative to the benchmark knowledge-based model error of 6.94\nand 15.53 days, respectively, in cross-validation. The hybrid intercontinental model applies to a much wider range of man-\nagement and temperature conditions than previous mechanistic models, enabling improved decision support as alterna-\ntive cropping systems arise, farm sizes increase and changes in the global climate continue to accelerate.\nKEYWORDS: crop model; ensemble; machine learning; phenology; soybean; super learner\n1.

Romaji – A escrita\nSe você é fã de coisas provenientes do Japão, como músicas, animes, filmes e cultura\ntradicional, provavelmente já se deparou com diversas palavras em japonês escritas\ncomonossoalfabeto.\nExemplos:\ntaiko\n\nsushi\n\nitadakimasu\n\naishiteru\n\nOs japoneses dão o nome de ローマ字 (roomaji, ou romaji, erroneamente chamado\npormuitosbrasileirosderomanji)aosistemaocidentaldeescrita.Naverdade,romajié\nnada mais e nada menos do que a palavra em japonês utilizada para se referir ao\nalfabetoocidental.\nPorém, os não-japoneses, principalmente fãs do Japão, adotaram o termo para se\nreferir a palavras em japonês escritas com o alfabeto romano. Ou seja, podemos dizer\nqueaspalavrasutilizadasanteriormentecomoexemploestãoescritasemromaji.\nTalvez isto não seja novidade para você, mas este esclarecimento é importante,\nprincipalmente pelo fato das informações contidas na internet sobre isto serem muito\ndispersas.\nAgora, uma coisa que a maioria não sabe, é que não existem regras absolutas para\nescrever em romaji. Não existe correto ou incorreto, existem apenas convenções e\ncostumes,todoscriadospornão-japoneses.\nVejo muitas pessoas preocupadas em como escrever em romaji corretamente, ou\nentão reprimindo uma pessoa que escreveu diferente da forma mais utilizada. Isto não\nfaz muito sentido, uma vez que romaji é apenas uma transcrição do verdadeiro\njaponês.\nPara exemplificar o que estou dizendo, vamos tomar como exemplo a letra japonesa\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 9DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\n“か”(estudaremosdepois,emmaisdetalhes,comoasletrasjaponesasfuncionam).\nEsta letra representa um som, e a maneira mais próxima de representarmos este som\nutilizandoonossoalfabeto,éescrevendo“ka”.\nか →\nka\nPorém, antes de qualquer coisa, a letra “か” representa um som, não uma\nequivalência com a sílaba “ka” do português. O que quero dizer com isso é que eu\npoderia representar este som da forma que eu quiser, como por exemplo, com “ca” ou\n“cá”.\nNãoexistecertoouerrado!\nConforme veremos a seguir, cada letra japonesa representa um som, e não um\nconjuntodeletrasdoportuguêsououtroidioma.Nãoexistecertoouerradono romaji,\nvocênãodevesepreocuparcomisso.\nAgora o ponto mais importante: Se você deseja aprender japonês, você deve\nabandonar o uso do romaji o quanto antes. Escrever japonês em romaji serve apenas\npara demonstrar palavras japonesas a pessoas que não sabem japonês e não estão\ninteressadas em aprender. Você, que deseja aprender japonês, deve começar\nimediatamente a estudar a escrita japonesa, que ao contrário do que muitos dizem,\nnãoédifícilevocêpodeficarfamiliarizadocomelarapidamente.\nNa prática, ou seja, no Japão, o alfabeto romano é utilizado para siglas, nomes\nestilizados (tais como de lojas ou de produtos), para marcação etc. Os japoneses\nsabem ler o alfabeto romano, mas utilizam ou para estes casos citados ou para\nescreveremoutroidioma(normalmenteinglês)\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 10DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\n2. Os sistemas de escrita do japonês\nVocê provavelmente já viu coisas escritas em japonês e se deparou com diversos\nsímbolos e letras legais. De fato, a escrita japonesa é muito bonita! Além de ser uma\nferramentaparacomunicação,étambémumaarte.\nVocê já viu símbolos japoneses sendo escritos com o pincel, utilizando uma tinta preta\nem folhas finas que a absorvem muito bem? Isto é uma arte chamada shodou (書道\n【しょどう】).Seestáaprocuradeumnovohobby,pesquisemaissobredepois!\nEntre os leigos, muitos boatos correm soltos sobre a escrita japonesa. Lembro que\nquando eu estava no segundo ano do ensino médio, um professor de sociologia disse\nque cada única letra do japonês significa uma palavra inteira, sendo que para uma\npessoa saber 5.000 palavras, ela deve ter memorizado 5.000 símbolos. Como\nestudante de japonês, eu sabia que aquilo era um absurdo, mas todo o resto da classe\nacabou absorvendo uma informação errada e a repassaria por aí, e o pior, justificando\ncomoargumentodeque“Foiomeuprofessordesociologiaquemdisse!”.\nDe fato existem algumas palavras compostas por um único símbolo, mas são poucas.\nAssim como praticamente nenhum nativo japonês sabe 5.000 símbolos, mas\nprovavelmentetodossabemmaisdoque5.000palavras.\nO ideal é que você ignore tudo o que já ouviu por parte de leigos sobre o japonês.\nGuarde suas dúvidas e continue lendo esta sessão do livro, pois os principais pontos\nserãoesclarecidosdeformaclaraeconcisa.\nA língua japonesa possui três sistemas de escrita, e antes que você pergunte: Sim,\ntodossãousadosaomesmotempo.\nNa verdade, os três sistemas são complementares, cada um tem a sua função e seu\nmomento para ser usado. Uma pessoa que deseja aprender japonês, precisa aprender\nostrês.\nEstes três sistemas não tem relação com as letras maiúsculas ou minúsculas do\nalfabeto romano, ou da letra de forma e letra cursiva. É uma coisa completamente\ndiferente.

HIRAGANA\nO HIRAGANA (ひらがな) é o sistema mais básico de escrita do japonês. É o primeiro\nque as crianças aprendem na escola e com ele épossível escrever todas as palavras do\njaponês.\nApesar de ser possível escrever todas as palavras do japonês com ele, isto não é\nexatamente o que ocorre na prática. Os outros dois sistemas são amplamente\nutilizados. Muitos alunos já me perguntaram: “Mas por que não utilizam apenas o\nHIRAGANA,jáqueseriamaisfácilaprender?”.\nA resposta é: Porque não. Simples assim, é o que é. A escrita japonesa é como é e\ndificilmente irá mudar no curto e médio prazo.

Explicamos sobre as partículas na sessão apropriada, inclusive o uso\ndesta. O importante aqui é entender que existe uma partícula com o som de “o” que é\nescrita com a letra を. Apenas por curiosidade, há o costume de romanizar esta letra\ncomo “wo” (se você acompanha letras de músicas em japonês romanizadas já deve ter\nvisto).\nQuanto aos outros dois casos, realmente o som é o mesmo. Não há uma maneira\nlógica de saber se uma palavra utiliza uma ou outra, você precisa realmente aprender\ncomoescreverapalavra.\nÉ o mesmo caso do português, onde temos “ç” e “ss” para representar o mesmo som.\nSe você ouvir uma nova palavra com este som, e você nunca a viu escrita, é provável\nque você fique na dúvida se é com “ç” ou com “ss”.

Eles utilizam o próprio\njaponêsepalavrasqueoutilizamparadescrevê-lo.\nNo Japão, são ensinados durante o ensino fundamental 1006 KANJIS, divididos pelas 6\nséries, mas lembre-se que osjaponesesestão imersos o tempo inteiro.Entre a infância\ne a pré-adolescência, um japonês não se limita apenas aos carácteres que são\nensinados na escola.

Isto não significa que estas leituras são exatamente como os\nKANJISsãolidosnochinêshoje.\nOs KANJIS não foram importados para o Japão todos de uma só vez. Lembre-se que\nestamos falando de vários séculos atrás, sem toda essa tecnologia da informação que\npossuímos hoje. Com isso, um mesmo KANJI chegou a ser importado repetidas vezes,\npara diferentes regiões e em diferentes épocas, por isso quase todos acabaram\npossuindomaisdeumaleitura-ON.\nSempre que falamos em “o Japão importou os KANJIS da China” as pessoas tendem a\nachar que isto foi um processo sistêmico onde pegou-se as letras chinesas e adaptou\nao japonês. Não é bem isso, os KANJIS vieram atrelados as palavras. Milhares de\npalavras do chinês foram incorporadas ao japonês, e a maneira como o KANJIS era lido\ndentro destas palavras é que chamamos de leitura-ON. O ato de separar as leituras e\nclassificá-las foi algo feito muito posteriormente, para facilitar o estudo e a\ncompreensãodalíngua.\nGeralmente,equandoeudigogeralmenteéparaquevocêrealmenteentendaque não\né uma regra absoluta, havendo muitas exceções, a leitura-ON é utilizada em palavras\ncompostas por mais de um KANJI, sem que haja nenhum HIRAGANA acoplado.\nGeralmente (mais uma vez), estas palavras tiveram origem no chinês, e foi através\ndelasqueoKANJIfoiimportado.\nAlgumaspalavrasondeosKANJISsãolidoscomleitura-ON:\nPalavra Significado\nくうこう\n空港 Aeroporto\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 34DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\nでん わ\n電話 Telefone\nぼ ご\n母語 Língua mãe\nしんせつ\n親切 Gentil\nりょこう\n旅行 Viagem\nEstas palavras compostas são chamadas de jukugo (熟語). Falamos sobre eles ainda\nnestecapítulo.\nJá a leitura-KUN é a leitura japonesa do KANJI. Bom, entenda o seguinte: Antes dos\njaponeses desenvolverem uma forma de escrita, eles já falavam, já havia palavras para\nrepresentar as coisas. Quando o sistema de escrita chinês começou a aparecer no país\n(que não podia ser chamado de país, ainda, na época), aos poucos os japoneses foram\nassociando palavras do japonês aos KANJIS chineses de significado semelhante.

Muitos\nestudantesutilizamerroneamenteotermo “KANJI composto”, mas não existem KANJIS\ncompostos. KANJI é KANJI, cada KANJI é uma letra. O que existe são palavras\ncompostaspormaisdeumúnicoideograma.\nExemplos:\nPalavra Significado\nに ほん\n日本 Japão\nぎんこう\n銀行 Banco (Instituição Financeira)\nこうえん\n公園 Parque\nうえ の\n上野 Ueno (um parte em Tóquio)\nや きゅう\n野 球 Beisebol\nNormalmente é fácil decifrar o significado de um jukugo uma vez que você conheça o\nsignificado de cada KANJI, mas os japoneses só param para fazer isso quando\nrealmente não conhecem a palavra. Na vida prática, ou você conhece, ou você não\nconhece a palavra. Quando você conhece uma palavra, você lê da mesma forma que\nno português: Passa o olho e automaticamente vem em sua mente o som e o\nsignificado (ou você analisa letra por letra sempre?). Quando você não conhece uma\npalavra, você para, lê com calma e, caso não a aprenda automaticamente pelo\ncontextodasentença,podeprocuraremumdicionárioouperguntarparaalguém.\nAproximadamente 50% das palavras da língua japonesa são compostas por jukugo.

Aprendendo e estudando jukugos (que nada são mais do que\npalavras), você aprende palavras que podem imediatamente ser utilizadas ou\ncompreendidas, na língua japonesa, e também aprende automaticamente as leituras\ndosKANJISqueoscompõe.\nRadicais (部首)\nSe você já observou os KANJIS detalhadamente, deve ter percebido que várias partes\nse repetem em vários ideogramas diferentes.

Muitos alunos, ao iniciar os estudos, já\nme perguntaram se o japonês é realmente todo ao contrário. Bom, podemos dizer\nbasicamente que sim. A ordem das palavras dentro de uma frase é muito diferente do\nportuguês, sendo que em certos momentos é mais fácil analisar a frase de trás para\nfrente(seestivermostraduzindo,porexemplo).\nUma característica marcante do japonês é o verbo estar sempre no final.

Partículas (助詞)\nA presença de partículas é uma característica que chama a atenção pelo fato de não\nhaver o equivalente em línguas ocidentais, deixando assim o japonês um idioma bem\ndiferente do que estamos acostumados. Não é possível lhe dizer que partículas são o\nequivalente a preposições ou algo do tipo do português, porque não são. Em alguns\ncasos elas até podem desempenhar esse papel, mas o fato é que não há um elemento\nequivalente as partículas na língua portuguesa, portanto, estamos lidando com algo\nnovo.\nAspartículassão,basicamente,elementosquedemonstramarelaçãoentreaspalavras\ne frases. As partículas mais básicas ditam a relação entre cada palavra e o verbo da\nfrase.Hátambémpartículasparadizerarelaçãoentreumapalavraeoutra.\nNeste capítulo, explicarei as funções das principais partículas e utilizarei frases de\nexemploparademonstrarafunçãodecadauma.\nPartícula の\nA partícula の tem uma função bem simples e fácil de ser compreendida, exatamente\npor isso vamos estuda-la primeiro. Basicamente, ela indica que uma coisa pertence a\noutra,maisespecificamente,oquevemdepoispertenceaoquevemantes.\nVejaoexemplo:\n わたしのえんぴつ\nMeulápis\nA expressãoacimasignifica “meulápis”,sendoque apalavra わたし significa “eu”ea\npalavra えんぴつ significa “lápis”. A partícula の liga as duas palavras, sendo que a\npalavraquevemdepois(えんぴつ)pertenceapalavraquevemantes(わたし).\nÉimportantevocêfixarestaideiadequeoquevemdepoispertenceaoquevemantes,\nmuitos estudantes iniciantes confundem.

Basicamente,\ntem a mesma função do “e” do português, para dizer por exemplo “carro e caminhão”,\n“meninoemenina”,“paiemãe”,“cachorroegato”,“sushiesashimi”etc.\nVejaoexemplo:\n 本とノート\nLivroecaderno\nA palavra 本 significa “livro” e a palavra ノート significa “caderno”, logo, a\nexpressãosignifica“livroecaderno”.\nPorém, diferente do português, não há problemas em repeti-la mais de uma vez.\nLembre-se, quando dizemos que é semelhante ao “e” do português, estamos falando\nde significado, não de uso, mantenha a cabeça aberta para as diferenças e não queira\nusaro と exatamentecomoseusao“e”doportuguêsemtodasassituações!\nひつじ\n うしとうまと 羊\nBoi,cavaloecarneiro\nNa expressão acima, temos “vaca e cavalo e ovelha”. Não há problema algum em\nrepetirapartículadestaforma,nãoestáerrado.\nUm outro ponto importante é que a partícula と tem esta função apenas para ligar\ndois substantivos! Preste muita atenção neste ponto, pois é outra coisa que muitos\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 48DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\nestudantes erram. Você não pode usá-la desta forma para ligar dois adjetivos, como\nem “Aquela menina é bonita e inteligente” e nem para ligar duas frases, como em\n“Amanhã eu vou estudar e jogar futebol”. Limite-se a ligar apenas dois substantivos,\nparaosoutroscasosexistemgramáticasespecíficasumpoucomaisavançadas.\nOutrosexemplos:\n えんぴつとペン\nLápisecaneta\nけいたいでんわ\n パソコンと携帯電話\nComputadoretelefonecelular\nちち はは\n 父と母\nPaiemãe\nにほん\n ブラジルと日本\nBrasileJapão\nとうきょう きょうと\n 東 京と京都\nTóquioeKyoto\n 土と水\nTerraeágua\n 日と月\nSoleLua\n 犬と猫\nCachorroegato\n テレビとラジオ\nTelevisãoerádio\n 田中さんと福田さん\nSr.TanakaeSr.Fukuda\nPartícula や\nA partícula や é muito parecida com a partícula と, com exceção de que não\nrestringeapenasaositensespecificados.\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 49DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\nVejaoexemplo:\nくるま\n 車 やトラック\nCarroecaminhão(entreoutros)\nA palavra 車 significa “carro”, a palavra トラック significa “caminhão”. A expressão\nsignifica “carros, caminhões e outros...”. Ou seja, a partícula や deixa aberto a\npossibilidade de existirem outros substantivos do mesmo universo. É como se o\ninterlocutorestivessedandoexemplosdeitensdedeterminadogrupoedeixandoclaro\nquenãoespecificoutodos.\nUmexemplodeusoparaaexpressãoacimaseria:\nどうろ くるま\n 道路には 車 やトラックがあります。\nNarodovia,hácarros,caminhõeseoutros.\nNão existeumequivalente aestapartículanoportuguês, omaispróximoseria otermo\n“etc”,masnãooscompare,ousoédiferente.\nAssim como na partícula と, utilize-a desta forma apenas para ligar substantivos, não\nadjetivosoufrases.\nPartícula は\nEstaésemdúvidasapartículamaisutilizadaequemaistemosaoportunidadedeouvir.\nEla indica qual o assunto principal da frase, sobre quem ou o que estamos falando,\nqualéotópicodasentença.\nRepare que ela é escrita com a letra は mas é lida com o som de わ.

Estas traduções são apenas para você compreender o\nfuncionamentodapartícula.\nEntenda que, ao contrário do que muitos materiais dizem, a partícula は não indica o\nsujeito, não indica necessariamente quem faz a ação.

Primeiro, pode ser que o sujeito coincida com o\nassuntoprincipaldafraseeassimapartícula は acabaindicandoumapalavra quepor\ncoincidência também é o sujeito. O segundo é por causa da tradução adaptada ao\nportuguês, citado anteriormente. Se pegarmos duas frases completamente sem\ncontexto, uma com a partícula が e outra com a partícula は, e traduzirmos ao\nportuguês correto (ou seja, não uma tradução literal, mas uma tradução adaptada), as\nfrasesficarãoiguais.\nParaentendermelhoresteponto,vamosfazeroquejamaisdevemosfazer: Apresentar\nduasfrasessemcontextoedestaformatentarexplicarasdiferenças.\nやまだ い\n 山田さんが行きます。\nやまだ い\n 山田さんは行きます。\nAdaptando estas frases ao português, e quando eu digo “adaptando” eu me refiro a\nnãotraduzirliteralmente,ambasficariam:\nOSr.Yamadavai.\nÉ aí que surge a confusão: Onde está a diferença?

No segundo caso, estamos falando que o Sr. Yamada, que\nprovavelmenteapessoaqueestálheouvindodevesaberquemé,vaiparaalgumlugar.\nEncontrar explicações lógicas para esta diferença é muito difícil, pois os japoneses\naprendem isto meio que instintivamente, através da convivência, por isso, mesmo em\nsites e fóruns japoneses existe esta dúvida.

Ela simplesmente é utilizada no lugar do は ou が para dar ideia de\n“também”.\nExemplo:\nわたし くるま あか\n 私 の 車 は赤いです。\nOmeucarroévermelho.\nたなか くるま あか\n 田中さんの 車 も赤いです。\nOcarrodoSr.Tanakatambémévermelho.\nNa primeira frase, dissemos “Quanto ao meu carro, é vermelho” (estou usando a\ntradução literal que aprendemos). Já na segunda frase, uma vez que o contexto já foi\napresentado,estamosdizendo“TambémocarrodoSr.Yamada,évermelho”.\nPara utilizar a partícula も, é importante que um contexto prévio já tenha sido\napresentado. A ideia de “também” deve ser relacionada a alguma informação (ou\nnegação)jáconhecida,exatamentecomonoportuguês.\nImportante!Apartícula も nãoéumapalavraenãodeveserutilizadaexatamentenas\nmesmas situações que se usa a palavra “também” no português.

Muitos materiais de\njaponês para brasileiros dizem que a partícula を indica o objeto direto de uma frase.\nEste conceito não está errado, mas eu prefiro usar o termo “objeto”, sem especificar o\nfato de ser “direto”, por dois motivos. O primeiro, é que muitos alunos nem se\nrecordam do que é um objeto direto, e isto nem é muito importante para quem não é\nlinguista.Ooutro,équeexistemexceções,tantocasosondeo を éutilizadoparauma\npalavra que é o objeto indireto, quanto casos onde o objeto direto é representado por\noutrapartícula.\nPara não fazermos confusão, guarde que a partícula を indica o objeto do verbo. O\nideal mesmo é que vocêsaiba qual a funçãodelapara cada verbo, assimnão tem erro.\nSe você parar para pensar, no nosso cotidiano nós usamos pouquíssimos verbos.\nAproximadamente 20% dos verbos existentes são suficientes para 80% das coisas que\nfalamos.\nSejamosmaispráticos,vejaoexemplo:\nねこ にく た\n 猫が肉を食べます。\nOgatocomecarne.\nA palavra 猫 significa “gato”, que está acompanhada pela partícula が. Como já\nestudamos, a partícula が indica quem é que faz a ação, o sujeito. Desta forma, já\nsabemosqueéogatoquemfazoufaráalgumacoisa.\nDepois, temos a palavra 肉, que significa “carne”, acompanhada da partícula を.\nAntesdeexplicarapartícula を,vamosaoverbo, 食べます,quesignifica“comer”.\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 58DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\nJásabemosquequemrealizaaação“comer”éogato,poiseleestácomapartícula が.\nAgora pense: Quem come, come alguma coisa.

Por fim, o verbo 食べます, que significa\n“comer”. Está claro que はし, acompanhado da partícula で, é o meio pelo qual a\naçãoérealizada,éaferramentautilizadapararealizaraação.\nBastavocêperguntar:Comoqueaaçãoéfeita?\nParaooutrocaso,vejaoexemplo:\nえき ともだち ま\n 駅で友達を待ちます。\nEsperaroamigonaestação.\nOverbo 待ちます significa “esperar”.Quem espera, espera alguma coisa(ou alguém),\ne este indicamos com a particular を, que no caso é 友達, que significa “amigo”. A\npalavra 駅 significa estação e por estar acompanhada da partícula で, significa que é\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 60DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\nnela que ocorre a ação “esperar”.

Apesar de escrevermos com a letra へ, ao ler esta partícula, devemos fazer o\nsom da letra え. Mais uma vez: Conforme você fica familiarizado com a língua\njaponesa, não será nenhum problema no meio de uma frase ver que se trata de uma\npartículaeassimpronunciarcorretamente.\nA função desta partícula é muito simples: Ela indica a direção/sentido para verbos\nrelacionadosa movimento. Para exemplificar, quando você pratica o verbo ir, você está\nindo para uma direção, essa direção pode ser indicada com a partícula へ. Quando\nvocê envia uma carta, essa carta vai a direção de alguém, esse alguém pode ser\nindicadocomapartícula へ,eporaívai.\nExemplo\nしゃちょう おく\n 社 長へメールを送ります。\nEnviarume-mailaopresidentedaempresa.\nO verbo 送ります significa enviar.

Esta mesma frase poderia ter sido escrita com a particular に. Na verdade,\nem praticamente todas as situações em que utilizamos a particular へ, poderíamos\nutilizer に,dependendoapenasdapreferênciadofalante.\nEsta particula também é utilizada por exemplo para endereçar cartas e\ncorrespondência,porexemplo:\n ジョンさんへ\nAoSr.John.\nAo colocá-la após o nome, que em nosso exemplo utilizamos John, temos a ideia de\n“AoSr.John”.\nOutrosexemplos\nそと で\n 外へ出る。 (Emjaponês,istonãoéumpleonasmo)\nSairláfora.\nい\n どこへ行くの？\nOndevocêvai?\nふ ろ はい\n 風呂へ入ります。\nEntrarnabanheira.\nかいがい い\n 海外へ行ったことがありますか？\nAlgumavezvocêjáfoiaoexterior?\nしょうり みち\n 勝利への道。\nOcaminhoatéavitória.\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 63DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\nPartícula に\nChegamos à partícula que causa mais dúvidas entre os estudantes e é por isso que eu\ndeixeielapropositalmente entreasúltimas.Masnãosepreocupe,tentareiensinarnão\nsócomoelaéusada,mascomovocêdeveaprendê-ladeformaquenãofaçaconfusão.\nMuitas publicações sobre o japonês dizem que a partícula に indica o objeto indireto\nda frase.

Adjetivos (形容詞)\nOs adjetivos, em japonês chamados de 形容詞【けいようし】, servem para dar\ncaracterísticas as coisas, exatamente como estamos acostumados no português. Os\nadjetivos podem estar ligados diretamente à palavra que caracteriza, como por\nexemplo, em “O carro preto bateu no muro”, assim como podem pertencer ao\npredicadodafrase,comoem“Omeucomputadorélento”.\nExistem dos tipos de adjetivos no japonês: Os adjetivos do tipo “i” (い形容詞) e os\nadjetivos do tipo “na” (な形容詞). Aqui, os chamaremos de Adjetivos-i e Adjetivos-na.\nA diferença entre eles está, principalmente, nas flexões que eles sofrem ao passarmos\nparaonegativooupassado(nojaponês,osadjetivostambémmudamdeacordocomo\ntempo).\nAdjetivos-i\nOs adjetivos-i são assim chamados pelo simples fato de terminarem com a letra い.\nEsta última letra sempre está em hiragana, independente do adjetivo ser escrito em\nkanjiounão.\nExemplos:\nおお\n大きい\n\nGrande\nはや\n早い\n\nRápido\nふる\n古い\n\nVelho\nParadarcaracterísticaaumapalavra,simplesmenteocolocamosantesdela.\nExemplos:\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 71DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\nおお\n大きいうま\n\nCavalogrande\nはや くるま\n早い 車\n\nCarrorápido\nふる\n古いテレビ\n\nTelevisãoantiga.\nOsadjetivospodemserflexionadosparaosseguintestempos:\nNegativo\nTrocamoso い por くない\nおお\n 大きい 大きくない\nはや\n 早い 早くない\nふる\n 古い 古くない\nPassado\nTrocamoso い por かった\nおお\n 大きい 大きかった\nはや\n 早い 早かった\nふる\n 古い 古かった\nPassadonegativo\nTrocamoso い por くなかった\nReparequenestecaso,écomoseprimeiropassássemosparaonegativo(trocao い\npor くない)edepoispassamosparaopassado(trocaonovo い por かった).\nDesvendando a Língua Japonesa Página 72DesvendandoaLínguaJaponesa www.aulasdejapones.com.br\nおお\n 大きい 大きくなかった\nはや\n 早い 早くなかった\nふる\n 古い 早くなかった\nSegueabaixoumapequenatabelaparafacilitaroseuentendimentoeconsulta:\nFlexão dos Adjetivos-い\nPositivo Negativo\nおお おお\nPresente\n大きい 大きくない\nおお おお\nPassado\n大きかった 大きくなかった\nAdjetivos-na\nAo contráriodoque sepodeimaginar,osadjetivos-nanãoterminam coma letra な.O\nque acontece é que a letra な é utilizada para ligar o adjetivo à palavra que ele\ncaracteriza,masistonãosignifiqueelaelafaçapartedoadjetivo.\nOsadjetivos-naterminam comqualquer coisa,são palavras normalmente inteiramente\nescritas em kanji.

Verbos (動詞)\nUma característica marcante do japonês, ao menos se comparado com as línguas que\nestamos acostumadas, é o fato do verbo estar presente no final da frase. Primeiros\nfalamos as informações como ‘quem?’, ‘onde?’, ‘como?’, ‘com o quê?’, ‘a partir de\nonde?’,‘emque?’eoutras,paranofinaldarmosdefatoqualéaação.\nIsto acontece porque o pensamento do japonês é desenvolvido no sentido de se criar\num contexto (através das informações) para então concluir a ideia (com o verbo). Isto\ntambém nos leva a ideia de que as informações mais importantes sempre estão mais\npróximasdofinaldafrase,sendooverboamaisimportantedelas.\nForma de Dicionário e Forma ます\nNo português, dizemos que o nome do verbo é o infinitivo. Não encontramos verbos\nconjugados no dicionário, apenas no infinitivo. O infinitivo é o verbo em uma forma\nsemtempoesempessoa.\nJá no japonês, o verbo é encontrado no dicionário em sua Forma de Dicionário\nじしょけい\n(辞書系). Esta é a forma que dá nome ao verbo.

A Forma-て é\nutilizada nas mais diferentes situações, como por exemplo para fazer frases com dois\nverbos, para ligar um verbo a outro, em alguns casos para dar ideia de imperativo,\nentreoutros.\nNão vamos cobrir aqui todos os usos da Forma-て, pois não está dentro da proposta\ndeste livro. Vamos sim aprender como passar os verbos para ela e então ver alguns\nusos.\nA boa notícia é que se você aprendeu a passar os verbos para o passado, você\nautomaticamente já sabe passa-los para a Forma-て. A única diferença é que, ao invés\ndedeixarmosum た nofinal,colocamosum て!\nApresentarei uma tabela no mesmo estilo da utilizada no passado-negativo.

Furthermore,YOLO\nhas been extended in several ways to improve its precision and capabilities. Namely,\nobjectsegmentationbasedonobjectpolygondetection,Poly-YOLO,wasintroducedin[31],\nwheretheoriginalYOLOpredictionvectorwasextendedtopredictasetofpolygonpoints\ntogetherwiththeirconfidenceforeverydetectedobject. Furthermore,anapproachmo-\ntivated by a Mask R-CNN Faster R-CNN relation, YOLACT, was introduced in [32]\n×\nto provide the ability for mask instance segmentation with comparable results to stan-\ndardtwo-stagedsegmentationapproaches,butimprovingtheircomputationaldemands.\nLater,thisapproachwasextendedintoYOLACT++[33]withadditionalperformanceand\nprecisionboost.\nIncontrasttotwo-stageddetectors[34],YOLOdoesnotusearegionproposalnetwork\nbut integrates the whole process into a single architecture. It is split into encoder and\ndecoderparts. Theencoderservesasafeatureextractor. ItisrepresentedbytheDarknet-53\nbackbone, but an arbitrary backbone can be used. The features are decoded on three\nsucceedingscalesintothreeoutputgrids. Eachgridconsistsofcells, whereeachcellis\nresponsiblefordetectingobjectswhosecenterliesinsidethecell. Bydetecting,wemean\nthe regression on the bounding box coordinates together with class and confidence. In\nYOLOv3,eachcellcandetectthreeobjects,whereso-calledanchorsareusedforsuppress-\ningtheproblemofdetectingthreeidenticalobjects. Byanchor,wemeanaprototypical\nboundingboxextractedfromtrainingdataduringpreprocessingusingk-meansalgorithm.\nDuring training and inference, a cell is assigned three anchors and detects an object in\nthe output position where the intersect over union (IoU) over the box and the anchor\nismaximized. Comparedtotwo-stagedetectors,YOLOismuchfasterbutyieldslower\nprecisionofdetection.\nThe success of the YOLO algorithm family can be illustrated on a wide range of\ntasks where it was applied, such as face mask wearing detection [35], identification of\nplant diseases [36], pedestrian detection [37], forest fire detection [38], or safety helmet\ndetection[39].

Zhuetal.[18]achievedε = 0.25ontheirKITTIvalidationdataset.\nR\nAlietal.[51] tested only nonoverlapping cars with the maximum distance of 70 m and\nachieved ε = 0.29; they also reported that DORN [52] yielded ε = 0.11 using the\nR R\nsamesetting. Maurietal.[26]evaluatedKITTIforthreeclasses: car,person,andcyclist.\nConsideringthetestscenario,theachievedε forthesethreeclasseswas0.16,0.42,and\nR\n1.04,whichshowsthereasonablenessofourscheme.\n3.5. AblationStudy\nFirstly, we investigated the dependency of the distance error on the object’s real\ndistance. Becauseclass-awareDist-YOLOshowedapoorresultinthepreviousexperiment,\nweconsideredonlyclass-agnosticDist-YOLO.Theabsoluteandrelativedistanceerrors\nare visualized in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. Concerning Figure 3, we can claim that\ntheabsoluteerrorgrowsaccordingtoapolynomialcurveuntildistanceshigherthan80,\nwherethetrendisbroken. Thereasonisthatfewobjectslieinthisintervaland,therefore,\nthemeasuredvaluewasnotcomputedfromastatisticallysignificantnumberofsamples.\nSimilarbehaviorisalsoreflectedinFigure4. Here,wecanseethattherelativeerrorwas\nalmost constant for all distances except one meter. That is caused by the fact that even\na 30 cm distance error on such a distance yields an error of 0.3, which makes the task\nextremelydifficultandisprobablyalsoaffectedbytheinaccuracyofthedistancecapturing\nprocessitself.\nThenextinvestigatedaspectwasthecorrelationbetweenvariables.

Therefore,thesuitablewaytotrainDist-YOLOistousecurriculumlearning[53].\nFirstly,themodelwastrainedwithdataaugmentationandwefroze(settozero)thepartof\nthelossresponsiblefordistanceestimationtotrainboundingboxdetectiononly. Then,the\ncompletelosswasused,andonlythenot-distort-object-sizeaugmentationswereused.\nFrom Figure 4, it is obvious that the percentage relative error of the distance was\nformostcasesbelow10%. Theoutlierwasthedistanceofonemeter,wheretherelative\nerrorwas45%. Thatbehavioriscausedbythecurrentformofthelossfunction,wherethe\nsquareddistanceiscomputed. Weexperimentedwiththerelativedistancelossfunction,\nwhich would force the network to predict a distance with similar relative error for all\ndistances,includingonemeter.

Intheliteratureoverview,\nweshowedthattherewereapproachesmodifyingYOLOv3tomonocularabsolutedistance\nestimation,butnoonefullyintegratedthedistanceestimationfunctionalityintoYOLO’s\narchitecture. Toachievethat,weextendedtheoutputpredictionvector,modifiedtheloss\nfunctionbythepartresponsibleforabsolutedistanceestimation,anddescribedhowto\nmodify the training data. In the benchmark, we verified that distance estimation was\ncomplementarytoboundingboxestimationand,therefore,increasdstheboundingbox\ndetection precision compared to the standard YOLOv3. We evaluated two versions of\nthe designed Dist-YOLO, namely class-agnostic and class-aware, with the finding that\nonlyclass-agnosticyieldedsatisfactoryresults. BenchmarkingtheKITTIdataset,themean\nabsolutedistanceerrorwas2.5m,andthemeanrelativeerrorwas11%,whichsupport\nthe claim that the full integration of distance estimation into YOLO’s functionality can\nreach a significantly better result compared to solutions that build distance estimation\nonthetopofthemodel’soutput. Finally, wereportedthatthecomputationspeedwas\nidenticalforbothYOLOv3andDist-YOLOv3.

Rodrigues1\n1Universidade Federal de Viçosa\nSensoriamento Remoto, Fotogrametria e Interpretação De Imagens\nRESUMO\nEste trabalho teve como finalidade a geração de uma função de filtragem gaussiana adaptativa no ambiente\nde programação Julia, assim como outras funções necessárias à comparação desta com o filtro gaussiano convencional –\ncomo o método de detecção de bordas de Sobel, Gradiente Morfológico, e Método de Otsu para a etapa de limiarização.\nA estratégia de implementação escolhida foi adaptar a função da filtragem gaussiana convencional a partir da utilização\ndo inverso do desvio padrão da área sobreposta pelo operador do filtro (máscara), adotando-o como o valor de sigma\npara definir uma nova máscara para cada pixel filtrado. Com o emprego da metodologia adotada foi possível verificar\nque a função de filtragem gaussiana adaptativa apresentou melhores resultados que a filtragem gaussiana convencional,\nos quais são fundamentais para o processo subsequente de extração de feições em uma imagem. Com os resultados\nobtidos pode-se verificar também que o ambiente de programação Julia já possui a base necessária à criação de\nferramentas inerentes ao processamento digital de imagens orbitais.\nPalavras chave: Ambiente Julia, Filtro Adaptativo, Imagens Orbitais\nABSTRACT\nThe main goal of this work is the development of a function for the gaussian adaptive filter in the Julia\nlanguage,as well as the creation of other functions needed for the comparison between the gaussian adaptive filter with\nthe traditional gaussian filter – functions such Sobel’s edge detection method, Morphological Gradient, and the Otsu\nMethod for image thresholding.Theimplementation’sstrategyusedwastoadaptthetraditionalgaussianfilterfunction,\nusingthe mathematical inverse ofthe standard deviationof the area covered bythe filter’s mask, using itasthe sigma\nvalue, in order to define a new mask for each filtered pixel. The used methodology implied that the developed gaussian\nadaptive filter function returns better results than the traditional gaussian filter, which are fundamental for further usage\nin processes of edges acquisition. The obtained results also show that the Julia language and its programming\nenvironment already have the necessary base for the creation of tools commonly used in satellite images digital\nprocessing.\nKeywords: Julia Language, Adaptive Filter, Satellite Images\n1- INTRODUÇÃO atendidas.\nNo Processamento Digital de Imagens (PDI) Deve-se ressaltar que algo comum aos\npodem ser utilizados algoritmos de realce de imagens, a processamentos de realce e análise de imagens é a\nfim de tornar mais nítidos os objetos da, visando realizar dificuldade dos algoritmos de serem executados de\npostumamente a extração de feições presentes em cenas forma rápida.

Com a utilização do aplicativo, pode-se alem de se obter um\naprendizado matemático sobre curvas, obter conhecimentos sobre convolução de imagens,\nimplementar vários tipos defiltros e entender seus efeitos sobreas imagens,entender os vários\ntipos de ruídos em imagens e com isto, melhorar a utilização de técnicas utilizadas em\nrestauração de imagens. Enfim, é um aplicativo com utilização na matemática, na computação\ngráficaetambém no processamento digital deimagens.\nA Curva de Gauss\nA distribuição Normal, também conhecida como curva de Gauss ou gaussiana é uma\ndasmaisimportantes curvas utilizadas namatemática e naestatística.\nSegundo [5], a distribuição gaussiana foi primeiramente introduzida pelo\nmatemático Abraham de Moivre em um artigo no ano 1733, que foi reproduzido na segunda\nedição de The Doctrine of Chances (1738) no contexto da aproximação de\ndistribuições binomiaispara grandes valores de n. Seu resultado foi estendido por Laplace, em\nseu livro Analytical Theory of Probabilities (1812), e a partir daí é chamado o teorema de\nMoivre-Laplace.\nLaplace usou a distribuição normal na análise de erros de experimentos, o importante\nmétodo dos mínimos quadrados que foi introduzido por Legendre, em 1805. O termo\ndistribuição normal foi inventado independentemente por Charles S. Peirce, Francis Galton e\nWilhelm Lexis, porvolta de 1875.\nA curva de Gauss é descrita por seus parâmetros demédiaedesvio padrão, ou seja,\nconhecendo-se estes parâmetros consegue-se determinar qualquer probabilidadeem uma\nDistribuição Normal, a qual pode ser utilizada na aproximação para o cálculo de outras\ndistribuições quandoo númerode observações é grande[4].\nA curva deGaussde um conjuntoX é definida pela equação 1:\n1\n(µ−x)2\nG(x) =\ne−\n2σ2 (eq. 1 )\nσ 2π\nOnde:\nx Conjunto com n valores, tal que -∞< x< ∞\nG Distribuição gaussiana dos valores de X\nσ Desvio padrão dos valores de X, tal que σ> 0\nµ Média dosvalores de X\nEstadistribuiçãogaussiana temo formato mostradona figura 1, extraída de[5].\nSe a variável aleatória tem como parâmetros µ= 0 e σ= 1, a distribuição é\nchamada dedistribuição normal padrãoe a função de Gauss reduz-se à equação 2.

Como pode ser visto nas figuras, a curva de Gauss tem a forma de um sino,\nonde o desvio padrão mede o tamanho da abertura da boca, ou seja, quanto maior este valor,\nmaior é otamanho da boca do sino e logomenor é a altura deste sino.\nFigura3 – curvas de Gauss dos\nelementosdatabela2\nProcessamento de Imagens Digitais\nUma imagem digital tem como representação uma matriz bidimensional contendo\nnúmeros binários codificados de modo a permitir seu armazenamento, transferência, impressão\nou reprodução, e seu processamento por meios eletrônicos. No processamento de imagens, a\nimagem representada pela uma matriz, é constituída dos valores funções da luz incidente sobre\nos objetos presentes na cena da imagem, ou seja, os pixels ( picture elements ), que apresentam\numa correspondência bit-a-bit entre os pontos da imagem e os pontos da imagem reproduzida\nnatela de um monitor. Eles definem cor, textura,dimensão e posiçãodos elementos da imagem.\nA área de Processamento de Imagens em geral abrange operações que são realizadas\nsobre imagens e que resultamem imagens[1], [2]. Aárea de visualização abrange as operações\nde síntese de imagem, ou seja, a geração de uma visualização do modelo. A área de visão\nabrange as operações de análise dos objetos definidos pela imagem e a geração de modelos\nmatemáticos desses objetos. No entanto, antes destas operações poderem ser realizadas, uma\noperação muito importante em processamento de imagens deve ser também realizada: o pré-\nprocessamento da imagem. Nesta operação, todo o tratamento da imagem é realizado antes\nmesmo da imagem ser processada para seu verdadeiro fim. É neste contexto que este trabalho\nse encaixa, ou seja, operações pontuais realizadas nos pixels da imagem, com o objetivo de\ntratá-la.\nUma operação pontual importante no processamento da imagem é a digitalização da\nimagem, ou seja, quando esta é capturada por um equipamento qualquer, como, por exemplo,\numa câmera digital, ela deve ser armazenada eletronicamente, e isto é realizado, transformando\nos sinais da luz incidente na câmera em sinais digitais ( os pixels ). Esta operação gera a\nDOI:10.5540/03.2015.003.01.0118 010118-3 ©2015SBMACProceedingSeriesoftheBrazilianSocietyofAppliedandComputationalMathematics,Vol.3,N.1,2015.\nimagem digital propriamente dita, e é realizada através de outra operação: o histograma da\nimagem, que consistena elaboração de um mapaque contabiliza a freqüência deocorrência dos\nníveis de cinza na imagem, ou seja, quantas vezes uma determinada cor está presente na\nimagem.\nDurante a operação de captura da imagem, que é sempre dependente da luz incidente,\npodem ocorrer problemas nesta operação, e por isto após esta operação, são usados os\nchamados filtros digitais, os quais têm a função de operar uma imagem digital com o objetivo\ndemelhorá-lano sentido de poderser processada para os finsaquesedestina.\nFiltragemEspacial\nA freqüência espacial de uma imagem é dada pelas variações de intensidade ( brilho )\npor unidade de distancia. Se numa determinada área da imagem há pouca variação de brilho, a\nfreqüência espacial é baixa. De modo inverso, a alta freqüência espacial é revelada pela grande\nvariação de tonalidade por unidade de distancia. Portanto, a freqüência espacial descreve as\nfunçõesde brilho deumaimagem[4].\nNuma imagem digital, os limites entre diferentes materiais, expressos pela tonalidade,\npodem ser bruscos ou suaves. Os limites comacentuado gradiente são denominados bordas. As\nbordas são mais freqüentes e nítidas em áreas com alta freqüência espacial, como por exemplo,\náreas agrícolas, com alta diversidade de cultivos, limites entre áreas sombreadas e iluminadas,\náreas urbanas, malha rodoviária. As cenas homogêneas, tais como vegetação natural,\nmonoculturas, por outro lado, apresentamvariações gradativas.\nA filtragem espacial de freqüência consiste de operações espaciais que filtram\ndeterminadas freqüências no sentido de suavizar, como ocorre nos filtros de passa baixa, ou\nrealçar,como ocorre nos filtros depassaalta. Deuma formageral, filtros digitais tratamcomas\nfreqüências das imagens, e o uso dos mesmos, depende da finalidade do aplicativo no qual eles\nsãoutilizados.\nUm filtro pode ser implementado computacionalmente através de dois processos:\nconvolução e analise de Fourier. A convolução opera no domínio da freqüência espacial da\nimagem e seu uso é mais comum no processamento de imagens, ao contrario que a analise de\nFourier que é constituída de operações matemáticas complexas para separar as diversas\nfreqüências espaciaisda imagem.\nConvolução\nChama-se convolução ao processo de filtragem efetuado pelo deslocamento de uma\nmascara ( filtro ) sobre a imagem, pelo avanço de um pixel por vez. Define-se uma mascara\numa janela composta por um numero impar de linhas e colunas. A filtragem compõe-se do\ncalculo do valor do pixel central da mascara na imagem, em função do conjunto de pixels da\nárea coberta pela mascara. O processo é repetido para todos os pixels da imagem, incluindo os\nda borda, para os quais é criada uma borda falsa ( geralmente com valores iguais a zero ) na\nimagem.\nComo exemplo, seja a imagem mostrada na fig. 4a e a mascara mostrada na fig. 4b.\nConvoluindo a mascara sobre o trecho marcado na imagem, o novo valor A ( que corresponde\n3\nao ponto central da mascara ) na imagem será igual a: A M + A M + A M + A M +\n22 00 23 01 24 02 32 10\nA M + A M + A M +A M + A M\n33 11 34 12 42 20 43 21 44 22.\nA A A A A A ......

A suavização gaussiana é\nlargamente utilizada no estágio de pré-processamento da imagem a fim de enaltecer a estrutura\ndaimagemem diferentes escalas.\nMatematicamente, a aplicação do filtro gaussiano é realizada da mesma forma que a\nconvolução da imagem com uma função gaussiana, como um filtro passa baixa, ou como um\nfiltro de médiasimples.\nEsta função gaussiana expressa a distribuição normal em estatística e é mostrada na\nequação 1, utilizada para definir a curva gaussiana de uma dimensão. Como uma imagem é\ndefinida em duas dimensões, a função gaussiana utilizada no filtro gaussiano aplicado a ela,\ntambém deve ser definido em duas dimensões, ou seja, uma dimensão em X e outra dimensão\nemY. Isto é obtido multiplicando-se a equação 1 definida emX pela equação 1 definida em Y,\nobtendo-seassim, a equação6.\n1\nx2 +y2\nG ( x, y ) =G ( x ) . G ( y )t = e− 2σ2 ( eq.6 )\n2πσ2\nEsta distribuição tem o formato\nmostrado na figura 5, onde x é a\ndistancia da origem no eixo\nhorizontal e y é a distancia da\norigem no eixo vertical, e σ é o\ndesvio padrão da distribuição\ngaussiana dos pixels que compõem\naimagem.\nFigura5\nCurva gaussiana bidimensional\nQuando aplicada em duas dimensões, esta formula produz uma superfície cujos\ncontornos são círculos concêntricos, onde o desvio padrão define a abertura do sino formado\npelacurva.\nFigura6\nImagem Original\nFigura7\nFiltro Gaussiano\nDesviopadrão=1\nMascara 3 x3\nDOI:10.5540/03.2015.003.01.0118 010118-5 ©2015SBMACProceedingSeriesoftheBrazilianSocietyofAppliedandComputationalMathematics,Vol.3,N.1,2015.\nA filtragem gaussiana é comumente aplicada quando se deseja reduzir ruídos na\nimagem, como mostrado nas figuras 6 e 7. Na figura 6 é mostrado a imagem de Plutão e na\nfigura 7 é mostrada a imagem de Plutão suavizada por umfiltro Gaussiano de dimensões 3x3 e\ncom desvio padrão igual a 1.\nO filtro gaussiano utilizado na filtragemda imagem é obtido através da geração de uma\nmatriz gaussiana que será utilizada como mascara na convolução da imagem. Esta matriz é\ngerada utilizando-se a equação 6, atribuindo os valores de x, y e σ. Desta forma, para uma\nmatriz de dimensão 5, comdesvio padrão igual a 1 e ambos, x e y variando entre -2 e 2, tem-se\na estrutura matricialconstituída dosvalores mostrados natabela3.\n0.00078631 0.00655952 0.01330347 0.00655952 0.00078631\n0.00655952 0.05472049 0.11097944 0.05472049 0.00655952\n0.01330347 0.11097944 0.22507904 0.11097944 0.01330347\n0.00655952 0.05472049 0.11097944 0.05472049 0.00655952\n0.00078631 0.00655952 0.01330347 0.00655952 0.00078631\nTabela 3– exemplo de um filtrogaussiano\nPode-se observar na tabela 3, que o maior valor ( o pico da curva ) encontra-se no\ncentro da tabela, e os seus vizinhos vão diminuindo de valor circularmente, dando a idéia do\nsino mostrado na figura 5, exatamente como se deseja no comportamento gaussiano.\nDependendo do uso do aplicativo deste filtro, este pode ser ainda normalizado, ou seja, ter\ntodos seus valores divididos pela média de todos os valores da matriz. Assim sendo, não é\npossível obter-se os valores que compõem esta matriz, como por exemplo, o desvio padrão, a\npartir da própriamatriz, ou seja, fornecendoos valores dos parâmetros daequação 6 chega-seà\ntabela 3, maso inverso não é verdadeiro. Utilizando oprincipio da separabilidadedeste filtro na\nequação 1 com os mesmos valores de x e σ e novamente com os mesmos valores de y e σ,\nobtém-se respectivamente, os vetores G(x) = G(y) = 0.02804 | 0.23392 | 0.47442 | 0.23392 |\n0.02804, que multiplicados entre si, conforme a equação G(x,y) = G(x) G(y)t, resultam na\nmatriz mostradona tabela 3.\nAplicativo Computacional\nAs figuras 6 e 7 mostram os resultados obtidos por um aplicativo computacional\nespecialmente desenvolvido para este fim. Este aplicativo, escrito em linguagem Java padrão\nANSI [3], tem como entrada de dados, o nome do arquivo onde se encontra a imagem a ser\nutilizada na entrada de dados do aplicativo, ou seja, a imagem a ser transformada, ou neste\ncaso, filtrada. Na verdade, o aplicativo em questão, denominado LAB IMAGE, mostrado na\nfigura 8, tem várias outras funções praticas relacionadas ao processamento de imagem, tais\ncomo, filtragem da imagem utilizando outros tipos de filtros, rotação, armazenamento, entropia\ne ampliação da imagem processada.\nComo se está interessado apenas na filtragem da imagem utilizando-se um filtro\ngaussiano, o software permite ao usuário escolher o tamanho da máscara, que pode ser de 3 x 3\n( padrão ) até 11 x 11,dependendo da experiência a ser elaborada, lembrando que quanto maior\nfor o tamanho da mascara, mais operações são realizadas na convolução da mascara com a\nimagem. O usuário pode escolher tambémo valor do desvio padrão, que inicialmente é definido\ncomosendo igual a 1, mas pode ter seuvaloralterado.\nConclusões\nForam mostrados no texto, os conceitos básicos sobre a Curva de Gauss, utilizada para\no calculo do desvio padrão dos valores envolvidos numa amostra e sua extensão na aplicação\nbidimensional no tratamento de imagens computacionais, utilizados como filtros passa baixa. A\nfim de demonstrar os conceitos mostrados, foi desenvolvido um aplicativo computacional que\ntem como entrada uma dada imagem e como saída esta imagem processada com uma\ndeterminada função especificada no software e escolhida pelo usuário. No caso deste trabalho,\nestá se interessadoapenas pela opção defiltragem daimagem utilizando-seumfiltro gaussiano,\nDOI:10.5540/03.2015.003.01.0118 010118-6 ©2015SBMACProceedingSeriesoftheBrazilianSocietyofAppliedandComputationalMathematics,Vol.3,N.1,2015.\ncom escolha do tamanho das dimensões da mascara do filtro e também do valor do desvio\npadrãodos valoresda imagem.\nFigura 8 – programaIMAGELAB\nÉ um aplicativo ideal para o treinamento dos alunos em programas multidisciplinares,\ntais como, matemática, computação gráfica e processamento digital de imagens.

Com a utilização do aplicativo, pode-se alem de se obter um\naprendizado matemático sobre curvas, obter conhecimentos sobre convolução de imagens,\nimplementar vários tipos defiltros e entender seus efeitos sobreas imagens,entender os vários\ntipos de ruídos em imagens e com isto, melhorar a utilização de técnicas utilizadas em\nrestauração de imagens. Enfim, é um aplicativo com utilização na matemática, na computação\ngráficaetambém no processamento digital deimagens.\nA Curva de Gauss\nA distribuição Normal, também conhecida como curva de Gauss ou gaussiana é uma\ndasmaisimportantes curvas utilizadas namatemática e naestatística.\nSegundo [5], a distribuição gaussiana foi primeiramente introduzida pelo\nmatemático Abraham de Moivre em um artigo no ano 1733, que foi reproduzido na segunda\nedição de The Doctrine of Chances (1738) no contexto da aproximação de\ndistribuições binomiaispara grandes valores de n. Seu resultado foi estendido por Laplace, em\nseu livro Analytical Theory of Probabilities (1812), e a partir daí é chamado o teorema de\nMoivre-Laplace.\nLaplace usou a distribuição normal na análise de erros de experimentos, o importante\nmétodo dos mínimos quadrados que foi introduzido por Legendre, em 1805. O termo\ndistribuição normal foi inventado independentemente por Charles S. Peirce, Francis Galton e\nWilhelm Lexis, porvolta de 1875.\nA curva de Gauss é descrita por seus parâmetros demédiaedesvio padrão, ou seja,\nconhecendo-se estes parâmetros consegue-se determinar qualquer probabilidadeem uma\nDistribuição Normal, a qual pode ser utilizada na aproximação para o cálculo de outras\ndistribuições quandoo númerode observações é grande[4].\nA curva deGaussde um conjuntoX é definida pela equação 1:\n1 −\n(µ−x)2\nG(x) = e 2σ2 (eq. 1 )\nσ 2π\nOnde:\nx Conjunto com n valores, tal que -∞< x< ∞\nG Distribuição gaussiana dos valores de X\nσ σ\nDesvio padrão dos valores de X, tal que > 0\nµ\nMédia dosvalores de X\nEstadistribuiçãogaussiana temo formato mostradona figura 1, extraída de[5].\nσ\nSe a variável aleatória tem como parâmetros µ= 0 e = 1, a distribuição é\nchamada dedistribuição normal padrãoe a função de Gauss reduz-se à equação 2.

Como pode ser visto nas figuras, a curva de Gauss tem a forma de um sino,\nonde o desvio padrão mede o tamanho da abertura da boca, ou seja, quanto maior este valor,\nmaior é otamanho da boca do sino e logomenor é a altura deste sino.\nFigura3 – curvas de Gauss dos\nelementosdatabela2\nProcessamento de Imagens Digitais\nUma imagem digital tem como representação uma matriz bidimensional contendo\nnúmeros binários codificados de modo a permitir seu armazenamento, transferência, impressão\nou reprodução, e seu processamento por meios eletrônicos. No processamento de imagens, a\nimagem representada pela uma matriz, é constituída dos valores funções da luz incidente sobre\nos objetos presentes na cena da imagem, ou seja, os pixels ( picture elements ), que apresentam\numa correspondência bit-a-bit entre os pontos da imagem e os pontos da imagem reproduzida\nnatela de um monitor. Eles definem cor, textura,dimensão e posiçãodos elementos da imagem.\nA área de Processamento de Imagens em geral abrange operações que são realizadas\nsobre imagens e que resultamem imagens[1], [2]. Aárea de visualização abrange as operações\nde síntese de imagem, ou seja, a geração de uma visualização do modelo. A área de visão\nabrange as operações de análise dos objetos definidos pela imagem e a geração de modelos\nmatemáticos desses objetos. No entanto, antes destas operações poderem ser realizadas, uma\noperação muito importante em processamento de imagens deve ser também realizada: o pré-\nprocessamento da imagem. Nesta operação, todo o tratamento da imagem é realizado antes\nmesmo da imagem ser processada para seu verdadeiro fim. É neste contexto que este trabalho\nse encaixa, ou seja, operações pontuais realizadas nos pixels da imagem, com o objetivo de\ntratá-la.\nUma operação pontual importante no processamento da imagem é a digitalização da\nimagem, ou seja, quando esta é capturada por um equipamento qualquer, como, por exemplo,\numa câmera digital, ela deve ser armazenada eletronicamente, e isto é realizado, transformando\nos sinais da luz incidente na câmera em sinais digitais ( os pixels ). Esta operação gera a\nDOI:10.5540/03.2015.003.01.0118 010118-3 ©2015SBMACProceedingSeriesoftheBrazilianSocietyofAppliedandComputationalMathematics,Vol.3,N.1,2015.\nimagem digital propriamente dita, e é realizada através de outra operação: o histograma da\nimagem, que consistena elaboração de um mapaque contabiliza a freqüência deocorrência dos\nníveis de cinza na imagem, ou seja, quantas vezes uma determinada cor está presente na\nimagem.\nDurante a operação de captura da imagem, que é sempre dependente da luz incidente,\npodem ocorrer problemas nesta operação, e por isto após esta operação, são usados os\nchamados filtros digitais, os quais têm a função de operar uma imagem digital com o objetivo\ndemelhorá-lano sentido de poderser processada para os finsaquesedestina.\nFiltragemEspacial\nA freqüência espacial de uma imagem é dada pelas variações de intensidade ( brilho )\npor unidade de distancia. Se numa determinada área da imagem há pouca variação de brilho, a\nfreqüência espacial é baixa. De modo inverso, a alta freqüência espacial é revelada pela grande\nvariação de tonalidade por unidade de distancia. Portanto, a freqüência espacial descreve as\nfunçõesde brilho deumaimagem[4].\nNuma imagem digital, os limites entre diferentes materiais, expressos pela tonalidade,\npodem ser bruscos ou suaves. Os limites comacentuado gradiente são denominados bordas. As\nbordas são mais freqüentes e nítidas em áreas com alta freqüência espacial, como por exemplo,\náreas agrícolas, com alta diversidade de cultivos, limites entre áreas sombreadas e iluminadas,\náreas urbanas, malha rodoviária. As cenas homogêneas, tais como vegetação natural,\nmonoculturas, por outro lado, apresentamvariações gradativas.\nA filtragem espacial de freqüência consiste de operações espaciais que filtram\ndeterminadas freqüências no sentido de suavizar, como ocorre nos filtros de passa baixa, ou\nrealçar,como ocorre nos filtros depassaalta. Deuma formageral, filtros digitais tratamcomas\nfreqüências das imagens, e o uso dos mesmos, depende da finalidade do aplicativo no qual eles\nsãoutilizados.\nUm filtro pode ser implementado computacionalmente através de dois processos:\nconvolução e analise de Fourier. A convolução opera no domínio da freqüência espacial da\nimagem e seu uso é mais comum no processamento de imagens, ao contrario que a analise de\nFourier que é constituída de operações matemáticas complexas para separar as diversas\nfreqüências espaciaisda imagem.\nConvolução\nChama-se convolução ao processo de filtragem efetuado pelo deslocamento de uma\nmascara ( filtro ) sobre a imagem, pelo avanço de um pixel por vez. Define-se uma mascara\numa janela composta por um numero impar de linhas e colunas. A filtragem compõe-se do\ncalculo do valor do pixel central da mascara na imagem, em função do conjunto de pixels da\nárea coberta pela mascara. O processo é repetido para todos os pixels da imagem, incluindo os\nda borda, para os quais é criada uma borda falsa ( geralmente com valores iguais a zero ) na\nimagem.\nComo exemplo, seja a imagem mostrada na fig. 4a e a mascara mostrada na fig. 4b.\nConvoluindo a mascara sobre o trecho marcado na imagem, o novo valor A ( que corresponde\n3\nao ponto central da mascara ) na imagem será igual a: A M + A M + A M + A M +\n22 00 23 01 24 02 32 10\nA M + A M + A M +A M + A M\n33 11 34 12 42 20 43 21 44 22.\nA A A A A A ......

A suavização gaussiana é\nlargamente utilizada no estágio de pré-processamento da imagem a fim de enaltecer a estrutura\ndaimagemem diferentes escalas.\nMatematicamente, a aplicação do filtro gaussiano é realizada da mesma forma que a\nconvolução da imagem com uma função gaussiana, como um filtro passa baixa, ou como um\nfiltro de médiasimples.\nEsta função gaussiana expressa a distribuição normal em estatística e é mostrada na\nequação 1, utilizada para definir a curva gaussiana de uma dimensão. Como uma imagem é\ndefinida em duas dimensões, a função gaussiana utilizada no filtro gaussiano aplicado a ela,\ntambém deve ser definido em duas dimensões, ou seja, uma dimensão em X e outra dimensão\nemY. Isto é obtido multiplicando-se a equação 1 definida emX pela equação 1 definida em Y,\nobtendo-seassim, a equação6.\nx2+y2\n1 −\nG ( x, y ) =G ( x ) . G ( y )t = e 2σ2 ( eq.6 )\n2πσ2\nEsta distribuição tem o formato\nmostrado na figura 5, onde x é a\ndistancia da origem no eixo\nhorizontal e y é a distancia da\norigem no eixo vertical, e σ é o\ndesvio padrão da distribuição\ngaussiana dos pixels que compõem\naimagem.\nFigura5\nCurva gaussiana bidimensional\nQuando aplicada em duas dimensões, esta formula produz uma superfície cujos\ncontornos são círculos concêntricos, onde o desvio padrão define a abertura do sino formado\npelacurva.\nFigura6\nImagem Original\nFigura7\nFiltro Gaussiano\nDesviopadrão=1\nMascara 3 x3\nDOI:10.5540/03.2015.003.01.0118 010118-5 ©2015SBMACProceedingSeriesoftheBrazilianSocietyofAppliedandComputationalMathematics,Vol.3,N.1,2015.\nA filtragem gaussiana é comumente aplicada quando se deseja reduzir ruídos na\nimagem, como mostrado nas figuras 6 e 7. Na figura 6 é mostrado a imagem de Plutão e na\nfigura 7 é mostrada a imagem de Plutão suavizada por umfiltro Gaussiano de dimensões 3x3 e\ncom desvio padrão igual a 1.\nO filtro gaussiano utilizado na filtragemda imagem é obtido através da geração de uma\nmatriz gaussiana que será utilizada como mascara na convolução da imagem. Esta matriz é\ngerada utilizando-se a equação 6, atribuindo os valores de x, y e σ. Desta forma, para uma\nmatriz de dimensão 5, comdesvio padrão igual a 1 e ambos, x e y variando entre -2 e 2, tem-se\na estrutura matricialconstituída dosvalores mostrados natabela3.\n0.00078631 0.00655952 0.01330347 0.00655952 0.00078631\n0.00655952 0.05472049 0.11097944 0.05472049 0.00655952\n0.01330347 0.11097944 0.22507904 0.11097944 0.01330347\n0.00655952 0.05472049 0.11097944 0.05472049 0.00655952\n0.00078631 0.00655952 0.01330347 0.00655952 0.00078631\nTabela 3– exemplo de um filtrogaussiano\nPode-se observar na tabela 3, que o maior valor ( o pico da curva ) encontra-se no\ncentro da tabela, e os seus vizinhos vão diminuindo de valor circularmente, dando a idéia do\nsino mostrado na figura 5, exatamente como se deseja no comportamento gaussiano.\nDependendo do uso do aplicativo deste filtro, este pode ser ainda normalizado, ou seja, ter\ntodos seus valores divididos pela média de todos os valores da matriz. Assim sendo, não é\npossível obter-se os valores que compõem esta matriz, como por exemplo, o desvio padrão, a\npartir da própriamatriz, ou seja, fornecendoos valores dos parâmetros daequação 6 chega-seà\ntabela 3, maso inverso não é verdadeiro. Utilizando oprincipio da separabilidadedeste filtro na\nequação 1 com os mesmos valores de x e σ e novamente com os mesmos valores de y e σ,\nobtém-se respectivamente, os vetores G(x) = G(y) = 0.02804 | 0.23392 | 0.47442 | 0.23392 |\n0.02804, que multiplicados entre si, conforme a equação G(x,y) = G(x) G(y)t, resultam na\nmatriz mostradona tabela 3.\nAplicativo Computacional\nAs figuras 6 e 7 mostram os resultados obtidos por um aplicativo computacional\nespecialmente desenvolvido para este fim. Este aplicativo, escrito em linguagem Java padrão\nANSI [3], tem como entrada de dados, o nome do arquivo onde se encontra a imagem a ser\nutilizada na entrada de dados do aplicativo, ou seja, a imagem a ser transformada, ou neste\ncaso, filtrada. Na verdade, o aplicativo em questão, denominado LAB IMAGE, mostrado na\nfigura 8, tem várias outras funções praticas relacionadas ao processamento de imagem, tais\ncomo, filtragem da imagem utilizando outros tipos de filtros, rotação, armazenamento, entropia\ne ampliação da imagem processada.\nComo se está interessado apenas na filtragem da imagem utilizando-se um filtro\ngaussiano, o software permite ao usuário escolher o tamanho da máscara, que pode ser de 3 x 3\n( padrão ) até 11 x 11,dependendo da experiência a ser elaborada, lembrando que quanto maior\nfor o tamanho da mascara, mais operações são realizadas na convolução da mascara com a\nimagem. O usuário pode escolher tambémo valor do desvio padrão, que inicialmente é definido\ncomosendo igual a 1, mas pode ter seuvaloralterado.\nConclusões\nForam mostrados no texto, os conceitos básicos sobre a Curva de Gauss, utilizada para\no calculo do desvio padrão dos valores envolvidos numa amostra e sua extensão na aplicação\nbidimensional no tratamento de imagens computacionais, utilizados como filtros passa baixa. A\nfim de demonstrar os conceitos mostrados, foi desenvolvido um aplicativo computacional que\ntem como entrada uma dada imagem e como saída esta imagem processada com uma\ndeterminada função especificada no software e escolhida pelo usuário. No caso deste trabalho,\nestá se interessadoapenas pela opção defiltragem daimagem utilizando-seumfiltro gaussiano,\nDOI:10.5540/03.2015.003.01.0118 010118-6 ©2015SBMACProceedingSeriesoftheBrazilianSocietyofAppliedandComputationalMathematics,Vol.3,N.1,2015.\ncom escolha do tamanho das dimensões da mascara do filtro e também do valor do desvio\npadrãodos valoresda imagem.\nFigura 8 – programaIMAGELAB\nÉ um aplicativo ideal para o treinamento dos alunos em programas multidisciplinares,\ntais como, matemática, computação gráfica e processamento digital de imagens.
